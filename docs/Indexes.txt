Since indexes only affect query speed, they are not considered necessary for DD implementations.
Meaning that you could remove or add indexes as you please since it doesn't affect the "standard".

The current strategy for indexes is to put one for every entry point in a query.
i.e. If you try to find something withe x value as a conditon, x will have an index.
Indexes try to be unique, even if it means including unecessary columns.
Size of indexes insn't a concern since even with a lot (non-redundant) indexes, 
the database will likely never be bigger than half a gigabyte in average worst case. (as estimated guess)

The only limitation then is insert speed.
Which is already really, really slow for HDD, 
since SQLite doesn't consider an insert successful until it has been safely written to disk.

With that said, this is a list of all indexes included by default.

Quick notes about naming
UQ = Unique
CO = Covered

Covered here indicates an index that contains columns that would be complete out-points for a query.
This does not include indexes that contain irrelavant columns (columns that are included only to make indexes unique).

Each index follows the naming scheme: IX_{Unique}_{Covered}_{Table}_{Columns}
